WARNING - Logs are world readable on pre-4.1 devices. A malicious app could potentially retrieve sensitive data from the logs.
ISSUES - APP COMPONENT ATTACK SURFACE
WARNING - The backup element is not specified in the manifest, which therefore defaults to true. Potential for data theft via local attacks via adb backup, if the device has USB debugging enabled (not common). More info: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup
POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY - The android:debuggable flag is manually set to true in the AndroidManifest.xml. This will cause your application to be debuggable in production builds and can result in data leakage and other security issues. It is not necessary to set the android:debuggable flag in the manifest, it will be set appropriately automatically by the tools. More info: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#debug

INFO - WEBVIEW DEFAULTS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE OVERRIDDEN-DISPLAYING DEFAULTS:
WARNING - All Webviews in JellyBean (4.3 - API <= 18) have catastrophic Same Origin Policy Flaws. You should not support these versions, unless your WebView never loads content from external domains. Google no longer supports patching the browser used in these WebViews: http://stanford.edu/~pcm2d/blog/webview_sop.html.
INFO - JS not enabled on this webView.
INFO - BaseURL not redefined in this WebView.
WARNING - File system access is enabled in this WebView. If untrusted data is used to specify the URL opened by this WebView, a malicious app or site may be able to read your app's private files, if it returns the response to them. To validate this vulnerability, load the following url in this WebView: http://www.secbro.com/qark/poc/FILE_SYS_WARN.html. Note: A local copy of this html file can also be found at <install_dir>/quark/poc/html/FILE_SYS_WARN.htmlIf untrusted data is used to specify the URL opened by this WebView, a malicious app or site may be able to read your app's private files, if it returns the response to them.

WARNING - While not a vulnerability by itself, it appears this app does not explicitly disable Content Provider access from WebViews. If the WebViews take in untrusted input, this can allow for data theft. To validate this vulnerability, load the following url in this WebView: http://www.secbro.com/qark/poc/WV_CPA_WARNING.html.

WARNING - JavaScript running in a file scheme context can access content from any origin. This is an insecure default value for minSdkVersion < 16 or may have been overridden (setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs) in later versions. To validate this vulnerability, load the following url in this WebView: http://www.secbro.com/qark/poc/UNIV_FILE_WARNING.html.

WARNING - Please use the exploit APK to manually test for TapJacking until we have a chance to complete this module. The impact should be verified manually anyway, so have fun...
ISSUES - ADB EXPLOIT COMMANDS
INFO - Until we perfect this, for manually testing, run the following command to see all the options and their meanings: adb shell am. Make sure to update qark frequently to get all the enhancements!
